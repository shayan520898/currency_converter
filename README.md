# 💱 Currency Converter Web App

# The Currency Converter Web App is a simple yet powerful tool built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

# It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies in real time using exchange rate APIs.

# Designed with a clean interface and responsive layout, this app makes international currency conversion fast, accurate, and user-friendly — all from your browser.

# 🧠 About The Project

# The goal of this project was to create a web-based currency converter that’s lightweight, accurate, and visually appealing.

# Instead of relying on complex or cluttered tools, this app provides a clean space where users can select currencies, input an amount, and instantly see the converted value.

# The app fetches real-time exchange rates from a currency API and displays the results with smooth functionality and minimal delay.

# Every element — from the dropdowns to the layout — was built with clarity and usability in mind.

# ⚙️ How It Works

# 1. The user enters an amount in the input box.

# 2. Two currencies are selected — one for the base and one for the target.

# 3. The app sends a request to the currency exchange API.

# 4. The returned exchange rate is used to calculate the converted value.

# 5. The result is displayed instantly on the screen.

# The process is seamless, efficient, and happens entirely in the browser without reloading the page.

# 🧩 What I Learned

# Through building this project, I learned how to:

# - Work with external APIs and handle asynchronous data

# - Manage dropdown inputs dynamically

# - Validate user input for better user experience

# - Apply responsive CSS techniques for adaptive layouts

# - Create a functional app that solves a real-world problem

# This project strengthened my understanding of API handling and real-time data rendering.
